# Form-Validation

A form is created using basic HTML code, Bootstrap and styling is done using CSS.

The Form validation is performed on Form making it impossible for the user to submit the form unless all the mandatory fields are filled.

RegEx is also applied on few input fields making it impossible to fill the data with wrong or invalid format for that field. For example, the field for Contact Number should be able to hold only numbers and not any alphabets.
